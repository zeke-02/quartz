Why did the birth of the internet not launch a two-decade long Renaissance and explosion of invention and new great men and women? If people believe that raw cognitive horsepower is the only convenient measuring stick by which they base their societal worth then they recognize and reward the very trait that makes us human; creativity. At scale we have failed to see that, ahem, *caring/obsession* is a superpower. Intelligent LLMs, trained with inductivist, bayesian techniques are indeed powerful mediums to translate and transform humanity's interface with the edifice of knowledge that has been delicately erected and pruned for centuries. 
However, what makes humans, and eventually AGI, powerful is creative ability. That monumental edifice of knowledge was only constructed from creative conjecture and creative criticism. My definition of intelligence is data compression, which is absolutely pivotal in an era overflowing with information, but not everything.
