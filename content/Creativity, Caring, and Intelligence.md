Why did the birth of the internet not launch a two-decade long Renaissance? A historical inflection point that utterly transformed society? An explosion of invention and art? New heroes to aspire to? If people believe that raw cognitive horsepower is the only measuring stick by which they base their worth, then they will fail to recognize and reward the very trait that makes us human; creativity. Intelligent LLMs, trained with inductivist, bayesian techniques are indeed powerful mediums to translate and transform humanity's interface with the edifice of knowledge that has been delicately erected and pruned for centuries. However, what makes humans, and eventually AGI, powerful is creative ability. That monumental edifice of knowledge was only constructed from creative conjecture and creative criticism. My definition of intelligence is data compression, which is absolutely pivotal in an era overflowing with information, but not everything. I believe that, ahem, *caring/creativity* is a the only thing that matters now.
