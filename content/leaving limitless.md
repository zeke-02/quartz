This summer in Singapore I left a Defi company I co-founded during college after spending 1.5 years putting in anywhere from 60 to 80 hour weeks.

# Why I quit
I left my DeFi company on August 8th, 2024, in Singapore after talking with my co-founder and our main investor for three days. They wanted to pivot the company, keep iterating, and raise again in 3 months, but I wanted to leave. I entered the space because I believed, and still do, in digital property rights, uncensorability, freedom of transaction, freedom from tyrannical dictators and their price controls, and building systems that align incentives with real public goods. For a variety of reasons, I became disillusioned by the DeFi industry and was quite distraught after having spent all this time in the wrong direction.

# What I learned
If I’m being brutally honest I think sometimes you just take the L and just have to keep moving. I’m not going to list out all the things I sacrificed, but I think next time I try something like this, it needs to be for something I truly believe in and desire to see in the world. That being said, here’s what I thought about the day after I quit:

## The weight of beliefs
Many people have strong opinions, especially on X, but who has truly risked something for their beliefs. Who has let their professed values constrain and mold them into who they are today? How much are you willing to do for what you think is right?

## Independence of thought
I would say that I learned the value of thinking for yourself. I wanted to leave many times before, but my cofounder would convince me otherwise and while I think he is very smart, ultimately I was not doing enough to really derive for myself what I believed and thought. Independence of thought is really hard. Am working on this.

good friends are a raison d’être
