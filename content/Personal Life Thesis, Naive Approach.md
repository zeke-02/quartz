*Disclaimer: My views constantly change as I learn more about the world and I will be periodically updating this piece.*

While I haven’t done much in my life thus far, at the moment I feel very privileged to dream and to try and manifest my vision of the future with my own blood, sweat, and tears over the course of my life. It might be incredibly naive or stupid to believe that this is at all possible, but I am willing to dedicate my life to that proposition. As of 2023, the average Chinese American male will live to approximately [87 years old]([https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/5/1631/178726/Examining-Ethnic-Variation-in-Life-Expectancy](https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/5/1631/178726/Examining-Ethnic-Variation-in-Life-Expectancy)). So barring any breakthroughs in [longevity](https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon) [science](https://x.com/LauraDeming), apocalyptic nuclear holocausts, and a broken heart, I will [die](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WE65pBLQvNk3h3Dnr/cryonics-is-free) around the year 2090. Setting aside discussions of *technique* and *method* to achieve my goals, this paper will serve as a personal record of my vision.

> What is your personal vision of the future? What would you like to see exist?

# I would like to see everyone be awesome.

I strongly desire a world full of beautiful builders. Of dreamers. Of scientists. Of creatives. As of this [moment](https://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PossibleMinds_Deutsch.pdf), I see AI, along with a slew of other magic, as a great multiplier of our creativity and ability to problem solve and new knowledge creation as the final frontier for human development.

  > “But Zeke, most people aren’t problem-solvers or creatives. Those only exist on X or Corners of the Internet or on the Joe Rogan Podcast” I hear you say.

I don’t see any reason why this must be the case.
1. Culture is downstream of technology. I have seen a generation of minds ruined by consuming passive, inundating content from screens, this can change. Also the medium is the message.
2. We were all kids once and were certainly capable of the intrinsic curiosity and disobedience (possible minds) required for creativity.
3. If *caring is a superpower* and [nothing is intrinsically difficult](https://guzey.com/education/is-anything-inherently-difficult/) , then given the right systems design and technological advancements, everyone is fully capable of realizing their individual genius. If the 20th century was about lifting people out of poverty (Roots of Progress Article), then the 21st will be about liberating souls/minds mired in poorly designed systems and burdened by overwhelming physical/mental costs of living.

# I would like to see beautiful, intelligently designed physical living spaces
Whether this be the cities on the moon or on mars or on Earth.

# Technologies

I think of myself less of a technological optimist; it would be closer to say that I’m a human optimist. Here are some technologies/problems I’m going to explore over the course of my life.

## Healthcare

### Healthcare systems are slow-moving, poorly designed, and can do so much more for the average American and Medical Innovation is so shit (star wars hospital)?
how does it suck?

### Biodefense/Covid literally almost took us out, we basically just got lucky???. What the hell? Why is no one working on building up our immune defense systems? Building better hospitals? Investing billions into biodefense? Improving our pandemic capacity? Would we be able to muster up the institutional competence to divert an incoming asteroid? or just rely on Elon?
  
## Education/Science
Gutenberg, but for Science (Guzey)?

## Biology

### Polygenic Gene Editing / Iterative Mitosis

### Bioelectricity / Anatomical Compiler / Alternative Approach

### BCIs

## Decentralization

### Decentralization of Atoms

### Decentralization of State Capacity (Network States)  

# Am I too old?  
ehh, maybe. Most of the people I see who have an impact on the world start quite young. Worst case scenario I will have kids and raise them to be great (this is not a joke).

# Am I going to try?  
fuck yes.

# Miscellaneous Goals:

- build a public laboratory (Thomas Edison)  / modern incarnation of a library / free compute/hardware makerspace that everyone can use. This would require me to get quite rich…
    
- find a wife. This would require me to get quite rich…
    
- learn to draw
    
- learn to create my own melodies
    
- good friends
    

  

Externally:

  

I would like to have many good friends.

  

what is required to accomplish these things? effort + courage?

  

I would like to find/build love

  

I want to build a public laboratory like Edison

covid almost took us out

we have to make sure we don’t kill ourselves with nukes

- knowledge preservation project
    

Diamond Age + Seveneves + Rainbow's End

NeuralLink + polygenic gene editing

**need to go more into the weeds on each of these narratives, figure out whether they are true or not**

also like biodefense is important maybe?

way better education "systems"?

improving *us* through a combination of gene-editing + bioelectricity

longevity + curing diseases

healthcare is really terrible?

- why? Is this really the case?

- is decentralization an answer or not?

distributed technologies so people exert less control over each other by design?

build the ultimate education platform -> C3P0 & a really easy to setup lab

everything open-source

maybe amazon, but just for science & engineering -> is this basically hadrian?

sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic

star wars medicine + new types of humans

I want to build/find a labratory where I could just fuck around in that has everything known to man.

are there DIY science kits available?

why is science shit?

create a hub for DIY sciencists -> pull stuff from reddit + amazon + youtube + etc.

- potentially create a science/engineering channel? how much of a value add would I really be though?

ok if I had to choose my future -> no technologies that *reduce* us. only ones that *make us better* and *empower*

my timeline atm -> 12 months, need to extend this by getting a job, I don't think that I could build a startup that would succeed atm, very inexperienced in the fields that I wish to contribute to + I am still narrowing down my interests.

  

what would you like to work on in your lifetime?

- idk I feel like the average human can be so much more, and just suck by default because of bad systems and education

- like it seems like it's mostly culture + incentives

- imagine utopia, in order to dictate the now and the course of your life

- beautiful scientists, creatives

- everyone is an entrepeneur/scientist/adventurer

- weather control

- manufacturing is creative

- cities are beautiful and intelligently designed

- but like we don't build things anymore?

- we have cities on the moon & cities on mars

- what problems are going to be solved?

- what are not going to be solved by the market?

- how much energy will we need in the future? What does a world without energy look like?

- why does energy matter at all?

- what are the timelines for energy and compute abundance?

- creativity not constrained by physical (except for laws of physics)

- super diverse and potentially disobedient

- you have to practice what you preach, come up with experiments, make predictions, lead the way if you wish to see this future, be creative and curious and super obsessive and solve hard problems

- each self-sovereign

- minimum systems necessary for like a working society?

- at every scale of organization is intentional and efficient, groups of people working on the future and hard problems. 

- it kind of just takes one generation to alter culture through technology I think?

- everyone is self-actualized

- flying cars (evtols) / self-driving cars

- there is option for struggle and adventure

- everything is personalized and works

- kids are given freedom to explore and rebel and build

- signal is abundant, not information, people can quickly parse through the noise

- everyone is ultra competent

- healthy food is super cheap

- everyone is very healthy + beautiful + high-IQ + very creative

- can run for miles

- can jump very high

- olympic-level fitness

- it's super easy and quick to transport to different places (cars or flying cars or some other device)

- kids/adults can all tinker and can learn things very fast

- there's a book:

- new atlantis by francis bacon

what sucks to you?

- gas is expensive

- medical care causes needless pain and suffering

- learn more about how medical care sucks?

- cost?

- talk to Will Mandis

- we are woefully underprepared for the next pandemic / bioweapon?

- biodefense?

- are we actually more prepared for the next one?

- could we improve our immune system's adaptability?

- drug delivery mechanisms of virus/cures, how do they work?

- could you improve your immune system beyond just like better genetics? some people don't get sick? Sean doesn't get sick? is it all lifestyle? if so, why?

- most people are scientifically illierate?

- implications of this 

- disease?

- what does it mean for there to be a genetic component of different diseases?

- why aren't most places like costco?

- what's great about costco?

- how can we improve the quality of life + education?

- what would a world of energy abundance look like?

- what is energy used for?

- what would a world without energy abundance look like?

- how much energy do we consume?

- how is that predicted to change?

- transformative ways to improve US

- education

- radical new biotechnology

- increases lifespan

- GLP-1

- improves cognition

- I'm not convinced that we can just alter the genes and get better people?

- how can we just use statistics and infer causation?

- I feel like since we don't actually know the underlying mechanism of change that it's difficult to see the actual consequences?
