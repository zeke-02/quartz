Why did the birth of the internet not launch a new Renaissance? An explosion of invention and art? A proliferation of young, new heroes to aspire to? 

In most modern education systems, raw cognitive ability, which is essentially data compression, has become the sole measuring stick for human potential at the same time that atomically engineered sand has demonstrated unbounded scaling in that domain. *Whatchagonnado*

This leaves us with only one choice, cultivate creativity at a societal scale.

Intelligent LLMs, forged with inductivist, bayesian [techniques](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/), are powerful mediums to translate and distill humanity's interface its singular edifice of knowledge that has been delicately erected and pruned for centuries. However, that monumental edifice was only constructed out of creative conjecture and criticism. As the models improve and the cost of energy and intelligence is driven to zero, the only scarcity will be creativity. 

This is great news! Creativity is basically just being *obsessed* about a particular subject so we should orient our entire society around *caring*.

Caring is the only thing that matters now.
