I got into crypto because I believed—still do—in digital property rights, uncensorability, the freedom to transact, and the need for alternatives to fiat currencies. I wanted to build systems that align incentives with real public goods. 

But over time, I realized the company I was working on wasn’t meaningfully addressing any these problems. This realization gnawed away at me for weeks and I was distraught over all the sacrifices I had made in this wrong direction. 

On August 8th, 2024 after a conversation with my co-founder and our lead investor in Singapore, I left Limitless.

I'd much rather learn from success, but here’s what I thought about the day after I quit:
- Many people have strong opinions, especially on X, but who has truly risked something for their beliefs. Who has let their professed values constrain and mold them into who they are today? How much are you willing to do for what you think is right?
- I would say that I learned the value of thinking for yourself. I ultimately I was not doing enough to really derive for myself what I believed and thought. Independence of thought is really hard. Am working on this.
