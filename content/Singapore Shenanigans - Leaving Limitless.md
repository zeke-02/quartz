I got into crypto because I believed—still do—in digital property rights, uncensorability, the freedom to transact, and the need for alternatives to fiat currencies. I wanted to build systems that align incentives with real public goods. 

But as time went on, I realized the company I was building wasn’t really solving any of these problems. It hit me hard—knowing I had poured so much into something that wasn’t taking me where I wanted to go.

On August 8th, 2024 after a conversation with my co-founder and our lead investor in Singapore, I left Limitless.

I'd much rather learn from my success, but here are three thoughts I had the day after I quit:
- It's important to look up from one's work. I need to derive my key beliefs from scratch.
	> "I shall rise and fall by my own deeds, my own brain, my own willpower"
- good friends are a raison d’être
- all professed beliefs have an associated weight; how far one is willing to go to live by them.
